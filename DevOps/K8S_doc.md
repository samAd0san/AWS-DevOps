### Drawbacks of Docker:
<b>Ephemeral Nature of Containers:</b>
Containers have a short life span; they can die and revive at any time. This ephemeral nature can lead to challenges in maintaining long-running applications.

<b>Single Host Limitation:</b>
Resource Contention: Containers on a single host share resources. If one container consumes too much memory or CPU, it can negatively impact other containers, leading to performance issues or container failures.

<b>Lack of Auto-Healing:</b>
Docker does not natively support auto-healing. If a container crashes or is killed, it requires manual intervention by developers to restart it. Continuous monitoring of containers is needed, which is not feasible with a large number of containers.

<b>No Native Auto-Scaling and Load Balancing:</b>
Docker does not provide built-in support for auto-scaling or load balancing across multiple containers. This limitation hinders the ability to handle varying loads dynamically.

<b>Enterprise-Level Support:</b>
Docker, in its standalone form, lacks the comprehensive tools and features required for enterprise-level support, such as security, monitoring, and orchestration across multiple hosts.

### Introduction to Kubernetes:
Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It organizes containers into a cluster of nodes, where each node represents a machine (physical or virtual).

### Problems Solved by Kubernetes:

<b>Fault Tolerance and Resource Management:</b>
Kubernetes manages resource allocation effectively across multiple nodes in a cluster. If a container on one node is consuming excessive resources or is faulty, Kubernetes can migrate it to another node, thus isolating and resolving the issue without affecting other containers.

<b>Auto-Healing:</b>
Kubernetes automatically monitors the health of containers and replaces failed containers without requiring manual intervention. It ensures that the desired number of containers is always running.

<b>Auto-Scaling and Load Balancing:</b>
Kubernetes supports automatic scaling of applications based on the load. It can add or remove containers (pods) as needed and distribute traffic across them through integrated load balancing.

<b>Rolling Updates and Rollbacks:</b>
Kubernetes enables rolling updates of applications without downtime. It can progressively roll out changes and automatically roll back if an issue is detected during the update process.

<b>Enterprise-Grade Support:</b>
Kubernetes provides comprehensive tools for managing large-scale, production-grade environments, including security features, logging, monitoring, and more.

### Additional Points:
- <b>Declarative Configuration:</b> Kubernetes uses declarative YAML or JSON files to define the desired state of the system, making it easier to manage complex configurations.

- <b>Service Discovery and Networking:</b> Kubernetes provides built-in service discovery and network policies, allowing containers to communicate within the cluster efficiently.
